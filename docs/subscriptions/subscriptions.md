# MobilePay Subscriptions

:::caution Change of Subscriptions API 

We have consolidated products on one joint platform. During 2024 you'll need to integrate to the new Recurring API to keep using Vipps MobilePay. After the 12th of March, you can transition to our [Recurring API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api/) using the [Subscriptions to Recurring migration guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/mp-migration-guide/subscriptions/)  


Key dates: 
 
- **2024** Plan and integrate new [Recurring API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api/) 

- **2025Q1** Be ready with your API integration to the Recurring API. The facade will be switched off. 

:::


Bill your customers with one-off  invoices or automatically on a recurring basis. Simplicity is key when opening the door to new subscribers, and MobilePay is synonymous with simple solutions and seamless transactions. Whether it's an agreement with one initial payment or billing on a recurring basis, it only takes a single swipe on their phone for customers to commit â€“ and to stay committed.
