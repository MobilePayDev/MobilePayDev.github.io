# MobilePay Subscriptions

:::caution Change of Subscriptions API 

As a part of the merger between MobilePay and Vipps, we will consolidate products on one joint platform. The facade will be active for about a year from the Nordic Wallet Launch. This means that you don't need to integrate to the new API right now, but just to be prepared that during 2024 you'll need to integrate to the new Recurring API to keep using Vipps MobilePay. 
After we have switched to One platform, you can transition to our [Recurring API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api/) using the [Subscriptions to Recurring migration guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/mp-migration-guide/subscriptions/) Familiarize yourself with what migration entails, so you are prepared for the migration process.


Key dates: 

- **2024Q1 March 12th** We finally launch Nordic Wallet Launch in Denmark ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° and migrate all Danish merchants

- **2024** Plan and integrate new [Recurring API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api/) 

- **2025Q1** Be ready with your API integration to the Recurring API. ðŸ§¡ ðŸ’™ The facade will be switched off.
