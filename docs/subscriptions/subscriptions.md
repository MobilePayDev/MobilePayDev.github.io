# MobilePay Subscriptions

:::caution Change of Subscriptions API 

Please notice that as part of the merger between MobilePay and  Vipps, we will consolidate products on one joint platform.  The facade will be active for about a year from the Nordic Wallet Launch.

This means that you don´t need to integrate to the new API right now, but just to be prepared that during 2024 you´ll need to integrate to the new Recurring API to keep using Vipps MobilePay. 

After we have switched to One platform, you can transition to our Recurring API using the [Subscriptions to Recurring migration guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/mp-migration-guide/subscriptions/) Familiarize yourself with what migration entails, so you are prepared for the migration process.

🙏 **Existing merchant**: Please review the upcoming changes outlined [here](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/docs/subscriptions/transition-to-one-platform) and update your current integration accordingly.  

Key dates: 
- **NOW** Take a look at the change list here and implement changes if needed for the Facade period

- **2024.01.01** Be ready with adjustments needed for your integration for the Facade period. 

- **2024Q1** We finally launch Nordic Wallet Launch in Finland 🇫🇮 and then Denmark 🇩🇰 

- **2024** Plan and integrate new Recurring API 

- **2025Q1** Be ready with your API integration to the Recurring API. 🧡 💙 The facade will be switched off.
