# Verification

Once you have finished testing in sandbox, you have to go through a small verification process, to ensure that your system is ready for production. We expect that you have tested all the features listed below, before you start the verification process. Then it can be completed in a day.

Once we have verified that the steps has been completed successfully, you are ready to start testing in production.

## 14-step Verification Process - Sandbox

To complete the verification, you **must** go through the steps listed below. This is done to ensure good user experience from the customer side. It is mandatory to test Subscriptions Payments, OneOff and Agreements in sandbox, even if you do not intend on implementing all functions right away. The sandbox environment is designed to be close to the production environment, which makes the process from sandbox to production smother.

When completing the steps, you must use a unique id as `external_id`. It must be unique in the sense that it is unique to your test, and therefore you cannot reuse an `external_id` from previous tests. Besides that, it can be whatever you like, with a maximum of 30 characters. You need to create three ids: one for agreements, one for a regular payment and one for a One-Off payment. Please send us an email with the three ids when you are ready to start the verification, and you can go ahead with the process.

Example of `external_id`: "external_id": "CompanynameAgreement"

**Agreement and subscriptions payment**

1. Create a new agreement
2. Accept the agreement*
3. Request a payment
4. Decline the pending payment
5. Request a new payment and wait until due date for this to execute
6. Cancel the agreement once the payment has been executed

**Refund**

7. Refund the subscriptions payment Note: refunds cannot be made for Instant transfer payments. Only daily transfer payment can be refunded.

**OneOff payments**

8. Request OneOff payment
9. Cancel the reserved/requested OneOff payment
10. Request a new OneOff payment
11. Accept the OneOff payment*
12. Capture the OneOff payment
13. You must also have a setup for handling cancelled orders/agreements, and cancel reserved payments

**Invoice details**

14. Add invoice details to Subscriptions payment

*Use the Subscription User Simulation API to complete this.

### Internal Self-verification
