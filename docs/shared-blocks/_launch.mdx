The new platform is already launched in Finland and we are exitied to launch it in Denmark on **March 12th**. We have gained great experience through the Finnish launch and want to highlight three main topics we suggest you to be aware of:
- Ensure that  you have *whitelisted our [new servers](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/developer-resources/servers/)* to ensure that requests and callbacks are successful.   
- Once the new platform is launched *all users must upgrade their app*. This is a force upgrade of the app and must be completed in order to access MobilePay. This means that a lot of users will update the app on the 12th and the following days causing their user journy to be prolounged. This may result in expired payments while the user updates the app. 
- Operational issues will not be sent to the old operational mail lists but instead supplied through our *new [operational status pages](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/developer-resources/status-pages/)*. Ensure to sign up for the updates through the new pages.
