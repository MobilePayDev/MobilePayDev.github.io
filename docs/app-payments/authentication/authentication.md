# Authenticate to the API

We are providing two different options for authentication.

- [API keys](/docs/app-payments/authentication/api-key): This is a simple solution aimed at merchants integrating on their own behalf. They are used to getting unlimited access to resources in your merchant account. These are retrieved through the MobilePay Portal. If you choose this option you simply need to [retrieve the API key](/docs/app-payments/authentication/api-key#get-an-api-key) from the MobilePay portal to get started.
- [OAuth](/docs/app-payments/authentication/open-id): This is aimed at larger merchants or integrators integrating on behalf of one or more merchants. It is used to get authenticated and scoped access to any MobilePay merchant account. Use them when your application will access resources on behalf of multiple MobilePay merchant accounts, i.e. you are an integrator. If you choose this option please contact developer@vippsmobilepay.com to get started.
