# Production

After getting your solution verified in sandbox we will enable the App Payments product in production and you can go live with your App. Make sure you have read our documentation thoroughly and adhere to the [build basics](/docs/app-payments/build-basics) before going live to give your customers the best possible experience. Make sure you inform developer@vippsmobilepay.com before starting the app rollout so we can help you monitor.

:::info
If you are a 3rd party integrator or supply your solution to other merchants you must contact developer@vippsmobilepay.com and inform about which merchants will use your solution. We will then enable App Payments in production for these merchants. Before this is done you cannot use the product for your merchants.
